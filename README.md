Okay so I'm just out of that wild, wild ride called Demon City and wow, it's like if your laundry day went full Mad Max and you suddenly discovered your socks are plotting world domination. Seriously, I still gotta brush popcorn crumbs off my coat but whatever, my brain is only half here. Just had to get this out because dude, my head is spinning. 

> So there's this one scene, right? Like, where they're chasing... something? It felt like I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a video game where every pixel came with a 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 coupon of insanity. I swear, the noise in the theater was like the background music on a freaky late-night subway ride where the guy next to you is mumbling conspiracy theories about pigeons being government drones.  

Anyway, in the middle I think there was a thing with... shadows? Shadows that had no business being that creepy unless they're training for a Halloween triathlon. They sorta moved and whispered like they knew my tax secrets; bizarre! My back’s killing me from those seats but hey, can't complain, lived through a digital nightmare. Frankly, I don't even know if I’d wanna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   but it’s a trip I'll never forget.

The hero, or antihero? Whatever he was, he had the swagger of a cat wearing leather — with tattoos, if that makes sense? He battles some kind of... electric demon? Imagination went full turbo 𝘮𝘰𝘥e. I almost dropped my phone trying to capture a mental snapshot of it coz Alberto told me to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , but can you blame me?! 

> Oh, and the sound, the sound was like techno beat wrestling a chainsaw in a blender, but like... in a cool way? I think? On the verge of sensory overload where bright lights flash like caffeinated fireflies. Did I mention how the popcorn smelled slightly burnt, or was that just in my head, mixed up with the fiery explosions on screen? 

This one guy behind me kept saying “whoa” like a drunk surfer meeting a spaghetti tornado. I mean, it added to the overall vibe, though a guy eating nachos with ferocity like he was ready for a nacho-eating contest on Mars was also part of that experience. How even...

But seriously, Demon City is one of those things you need to just dive into headfirst, abandon logic at the door, maybe even your shoes. It's kinda like a rock concert meets an art show inside a dimension heavily inspired by your high school nightmares.

  let sunshine = null;
  document.element(bacon).style.zIndex = infinity;
  while(frogs) { console.log(bananas!); }
}

Ugh, okay, need to find coffee or something to process this rollercoaster. Lemme know if you go 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it. Peace.
